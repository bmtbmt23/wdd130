        <p> Hello! My name is Bruna Beck. I'm originally from Recife, Brazil.
            I've been living in Utah for over 12 years. I moved here because my husband was from Utah.
            After he died (last year), I decided to go back to school. I'm truly grateful for the opportunity to
            learn web fundamentals. It's been an exciting journey so far. My goal is to become a software developer.
            I want to have a flexible work schedule and work from home. That way, I’ll be able to travel and spend
            more quality time with my daughter. </p>
