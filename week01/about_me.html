            <p> Hello! My name is Bruna Beck. I'm originally from Recife, Brazil.
                I've been living in Utah for over 12 years. I moved here because my husband was from Utah.
                After he died (last year), I decided to go back to school. I'm truly grateful for the opportunity to
                learn web fundamentals.
                It's been an exciting journey so far. My goal is to become a software developer.
                I want to have a flexible work schedule and work from home. That way, I’ll be able to travel and spend more quality
                time with my daughter. </p>
